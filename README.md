# Decisiones

1- Se Decidió crear el programa en Python porque la búsqueda laboral estaba orientada a dicho lenguaje.

2- No se implementaron las API's porque: a) No encontré relación entre el lenguaje de programación y un desafío "web".
                                         b) Hasta tuve dudas si me enviaron el enunciado correspondiente.
                                         c) implementé el juego lo mejor posible basado en mi primer decisión.
                                         
3- No se realizó persistencia de las partidas porque se terminó el tiempo.

# Enunciado
The Game
Develop the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe
Show your work
1. Create a Public repository
2. Commit each step of your process so we can follow your thought process.
What to build
The following is a list of items (prioritized from most important to least important) we
wish to see:
• Design and implement a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a
mobile app for your API)
• Implement an API client library for the API designed above. Ideally, in a
different language, of your preference, to the one used for the API
• The game is to be played between two people (in this program between
HUMAN and COMPUTER).
• One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
• The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the
players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective
character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
• If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
• Persistence
• Time tracking
• Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
Deliverables we expect:
• URL where the game can be accessed and played (use any platform of your
preference: heroku.com, aws.amazon.com, etc)
• Code in a public Github repo
• README file with the decisions taken and important notes
Time Spent
You do not need to fully complete the challenge. We suggest not to spend more than
5 hours total, which can be done over the course of 2 days. Please make commits as 
often as possible so we can see the time you spent and please do not make one
commit. We will evaluate the code and time spent.
What we want to see is how well you handle yourself given the time you spend on
the problem, how you think, and how you prioritize when time is insufficient to solve
everything.
Please email your solution as soon as you have completed the challenge or the time
is up.
